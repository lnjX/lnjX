### Moin Moin, there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a KDE Developer working on [Kaidan](https://www.kaidan.im/), [QXmpp](https://github.com/qxmpp-project/qxmpp) (Kaidan's XMPP library) and some other projects like [Plasma Mobile](https://www.plasma-mobile.org/). I'm active in the Qt/KDE and XMPP community. I like strong-typed languages like C++ and Rust.
